About the Utah Flux Network
===========================

The Utah Flux Network (UFN) is a statewide hydrometeorological network established by the Utah Geological Survey (UGS) to measure evapotranspiration, an essential component of Utah's water budget. UFN uses **eddy covariance** and **surface renewal** techniques to monitor water vapor, CO₂, and energy fluxes.

Goals
-----
- Provide ground-truth data for satellite evapotranspiration estimates
- Support water banking, drought planning, and climate modeling
- Enable consumptive use analysis for the Colorado River Compact

Stations
--------
UFN stations include:
- Agricultural fields (e.g., Wellington)
- Wetlands (e.g., Matheson Wetlands)
- Salt flats (e.g., Bonneville Salt Flats)

Each station measures:
- Net radiation, soil heat flux, latent & sensible heat
- CO₂, water vapor, wind speed/direction
- Soil moisture, temperature, and precipitation
- Air temperature, relative humidity, and barometric pressure
