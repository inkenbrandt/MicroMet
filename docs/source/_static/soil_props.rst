The amplitude differences and the timing (lag) between diurnal peaks in soil temperature at various depths provide valuable insights into the thermal properties of the soil, particularly its heat capacity and thermal conductivity.

Here's a detailed explanation:

1. Differences in Amplitude:
The amplitude (daily fluctuation range) of soil temperature typically decreases significantly with increasing depth. This decrease reveals important information about the thermal diffusivity and thermal conductivity of the soil.

Large amplitude at shallow depths (e.g., 5–10 cm)
At shallower depths, soils have higher amplitude temperature fluctuations because they are directly influenced by surface heating and cooling. The shallow soil layers quickly absorb heat during the day and rapidly lose heat at night.

Smaller amplitude at greater depths (e.g., 70–90 cm)
Deeper soils experience smaller temperature fluctuations due to the buffering effect from upper layers. This reduction in amplitude with depth indicates that the soil is dampening the heat wave traveling downward, reflecting the soil’s capacity to store and conduct heat.

Interpretation:

If the amplitude decreases quickly with depth, it suggests the soil has good heat capacity (ability to store heat) and relatively moderate thermal diffusivity.

If amplitude persists significantly to greater depths (larger than typical), it may indicate higher thermal diffusivity, reflecting either higher thermal conductivity or lower heat capacity. Conversely, soils with lower thermal conductivity or higher heat storage (high water content, high organic matter) dampen fluctuations rapidly, leading to minimal amplitude at greater depths.

2. Lag between Diurnal Peaks:
A time lag (phase shift) in peak soil temperature with increasing depth provides insights into how quickly heat is transferred downward through the soil profile.

Short lag between peaks
Indicates higher thermal diffusivity and higher thermal conductivity, meaning the soil efficiently transmits heat downward. Sandy or dry soils often show shorter lags because heat propagates quickly.

Longer lag between peaks
Suggests lower thermal diffusivity and lower thermal conductivity. The soil takes longer to transmit heat downward, often associated with soils that have higher moisture content, high organic matter, or finer textures (e.g., clays).

Physical Properties Inferred:
These thermal properties are related to soil characteristics:

Thermal conductivity: The ability of soil to conduct heat.

High conductivity: sandy, compacted, or moist soils.

Low conductivity: dry, organic-rich, porous, or loosely structured soils.

Heat capacity: How much heat the soil can store.

High heat capacity: Moist, clayey, or organic-rich soils (these absorb and release heat slowly).

Low heat capacity: Dry or sandy soils (absorb and release heat rapidly).

Thermal diffusivity (combines conductivity and heat capacity):

Higher thermal diffusivity indicates efficient and rapid heat transmission.

Lower thermal diffusivity indicates sluggish transmission, with heat primarily stored rather than rapidly transmitted.

Summary of what your observations might indicate:
Observation	Likely Interpretation
Rapid decrease in amplitude with depth	High heat capacity, moderate to low diffusivity
Gradual amplitude decrease, large amplitude at deeper layers	Higher thermal conductivity, lower heat capacity
Short lag time between peaks at successive depths	Higher thermal diffusivity (efficient heat transmission, sandy soils, dry conditions)
Longer lag time between peaks at successive depths	Lower thermal diffusivity (clayey, organic-rich, moist soils, or insulated soil structure)
These observations allow you to better understand the physical and thermal characteristics of your soil profile, helping you interpret soil water dynamics, heat storage, plant-soil interactions, and soil management practices.

Calculating soil heat flux (G) from temperature measurements at multiple depths relies on Fourier’s law of heat conduction:

2. Estimate or provide the thermal conductivity (

k): Thermal conductivity values vary by soil type and moisture content. Typical values (W/(m·°C)) are approximately:

Soil type	Thermal Conductivity (k) range
Dry sandy soil	0.25 – 0.4
Moist sandy soil	0.8 – 1.5
Moist loamy soil	0.6 – 1.3
Moist clay soil	0.8 – 1.6
If possible, estimate

k from literature values, moisture content, or from experimental data.
